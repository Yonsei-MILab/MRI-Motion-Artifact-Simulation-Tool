< View3Dmri >

1) Load data '.mat' file of from Workspace

2) click 'Change Variable' button, then you can see the
images at each view point.

3) The slice number of image can be changed by Using 
arrow key, typing manually, or drag the bar on each image

4) Resolution could by applied by typing the value

5) 'enLarge' button plots the image you see in another 
enlarged figure.

6) You can understand the menus and buttons intuitively.




< All plot >

* This tool is suited for 3D matrix data(stacked images)

1) Load data from Workspace

2) click the data you want to plot

3) Set the view point you want to see

4) Set the number of slices (slice ranges) to plot
(Default : from the start to the end of the matix 
along the direction in '3)')

5) Set the maximum and minimum value of color scale
(Default : min and Max values of the selected matrix)

6) Set the number of images in a row in plotting figures
(Default : 6)

7) Set Resolution of 3D matrix
(Default : 1.0 x 1.0 x 1.0 )

8) Select the color map
(Default : gray )

9) Do Plot !!

7) Select ROI tool and draw ROI. ROI can be modified 
before double clicking the left mouse button.

8) Masking -> show masked ROI
   Cropping ->  line : line plot
                rect : crop
                others : this button does not work.

< 3D Rendering >

1) Load data from Workspace

2) click the data you want to plot

3) Select between 'All range' or 'Crop'
if you select 'Crop' you should set the range of matrix
(Default : All range)

4) Set rendering colors 'Face color' and 'Edge color'
by using color tap or RGB value
Face color [1.0 0.8 0.8] is similar to skin solor

5) Set the surface value according to histogram(right-below)
This is a very important value for rendering.!!!!!!!!!!

6) Axes ratio could by applied by typing the value
(Default : 1.0 x 1.0 x 1.0)

7) set view angles (Az and El)
(Default ;  [ -37.5, 30.0 ] )

6~7 can be adjusted last plot. Just put the value you want 
and press 'enter(return)'

8) Do rendering!!!
